THE MAP-FORMAT

  Maps in Happyland consists of 6 'layers'. Not all are gfx, some are used to
  give tiles certain abilities. Here's a short explanation of the layers:
        1       base tiles, use this for ground and background gfx
        2       cover tiles, this layer will be drawn on top of all characters
                in the game, use it to create nice graphical effects and
                secret passages
        3       walkmask, each tile has a walkmask, these define how
                characters can pass through the space occupied by the tile
        4       items, this is for bonus fruits and special items
        5       npcs, happylanders, enemies and old men
        6       tile type, used to specify wether tile is a door, spikes,
                safespot or any other speciality.

  Maps can be in all sizes (except smaller than then screen). Use INSERT and
  DELETE with the arrowkeys to adjust the size. Eg INS and <- will increase
  the map by adding tiles to the left.


HOW TO USE THE EDITOR

  Before you create a new level, try to visualize what it will be like,
  or even better, draw it on paper first. It will make things much easier.

  Try to create the map in these steps, I find it the most suitable way.

        1. Draw the terrain
        2. Draw items and types
        3. Draw npcs
        4. Draw secrets

  When starting the mapeditor, a default map will be given. To get the
  file-menu, press ALF and F. To set the properties of your map, press
  ALT and M. Use the mouse
  to position tiles on the map. Left button to put, and right button to pick.
  Use Z and X to change tile (or press ALT+t for a tile menu). When positioning 
  the npcs, things are a little bit different. Use left button to position the 
  npc as usual but to remove a npc, click on it with the right button. Wise men 
  can be taught lines to say by pressing 't' when the mouse pointer is on them.

  The walkmask is set on automatic and unless you want to do specific stuff
  (like secrets) you shouldn't need to bother with it. Creating slopes
  however is a bit tricky. Read the SLOPE section further down. Make sure you 
  get it correct, look at the example map to see how it's done. You can use 
  the mask-checker (F3) to find most errors.


SPECIAL TILES (TYPES)

  Make sure to mark all spikes with the spike type. The same goes for the
  safespots for the happylanders, and exits. The door type is a bit special.
  When enough happylanders have been saved and the door is to be opened, the
  walkmask on the blocks marked DOOR will be removed, making entrance
  possible. Also, the cover-layer on tiles marked DOOR will be removed. Hence
  you should draw the door tiles in the cover-layer.

  Applying the ICE-type to a tile will create a slide-effect.


SWITCH BLOCKS

  In order to set up the switch blocks and the triggers you need to set 
  the correct types. The trigger tile should have the type SWITCH and the 
  green blocks should have the type SWAP. Don't forget to set the green blocks 
  to solid. (You also need to set the transparent green blacks to SWAP.)


SLOPES

  Making slopes in the editor isn't super-easy. Well, drawing them is easy 
  but making the walkmask work isn't. First, draw the slope. Make sure you 
  have a few solid blocks beneath it, otherwise the walkmask-checker (F3) 
  will whine.

  Now, when you have drawn your slope, switch to the walkmask-layer (3). 
  The walkmask is set automatically except for two positions. The top and
  the bottom of the slope. The tiles are often marked as complete solids
  but should be slope masks. Edit by hand until you get the correct masks.

  It should look something like this when done:  (excuse my ASCII)

  ______
  |  |  \		It's the mask (a) and sometimes the mask (b)
  |  |a |\ 		that you have to set yourself. Notice that the
  |__|__|_\		mask (b) is lower then the general ground.
  |  |  |  \
  |  |  |  |\
  |__|__|__|_\ ______
  |  |  |  |  \  |  |
  |  |  |  |b |  |  |
  |__|__|__|__|__|__|

  Take a look at the example levels to see how correct slopes work.


HINTS & TIPS

  Always leave lots of space at the top of your map. Otherwise, the player
  can jump into parts that isn't on the map and strange thing might happen.

  Make sure there are walls along the sides and spikes at the bottom. The
  game engine does not fix this by itself. It's up to you.

  Always do secrets last. That way you don't have to bother that much with
  the walkmask layer if you want to redo something.
  
  To get an overview of you map, leave the editor and drag and drop the .map
  file onto the editor executable. This will create an image that you can 
  look at. See the file maped.ini for more details.
