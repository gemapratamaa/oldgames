	<P CLASS="rvps2" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><b>Preface:</b></P>
	<P CLASS="rvps2" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">Though DxWnd is
	developed trying to make its use as easy and reliable as possible,
	in reality the variety of platforms, game engines, game releases and
	configurations make each case a real challenge and it will happen
	quite often that things won't be ok at first attempt. Because of the
	complexity of the task, the help provided by log files is really
	precious, and even though they might be really obscure for most
	DxWnd users, they can be grabbed and posted to the DxWnd forum to
	get some help. The following explains how to do this.</P>
	<HR>
	<P CLASS="rvps2" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><b>Setting up the tool:</b></P>
	<P CLASS="rvps2" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">DxWnd logs can be
	activated from the DxWnd interface in expert mode. So, if not
	already done, click on Options-&gt;Expert mode</P>
	<P CLASS="rvps2" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><IMG SRC="lib/dxwnd_options_menu2.png" NAME="grafiikka4" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=320 HEIGHT=218 BORDER=0></P>
	<P CLASS="rvps2" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">Then, the program
	configuration will show the &quot;Logs tab&quot; where the flags for
	logging options can be set. In most cases the optimal configuration
	will be the one shown here:</P>
	<P CLASS="rvps2" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><IMG SRC="lib/dxwnd_tutorial_logs1.png" NAME="grafiikka5" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=503 HEIGHT=535 BORDER=0></P>
	<HR>
	<P CLASS="rvps2" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><b>Log production:</b></P>
	<P CLASS="rvps2" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">The logs are written
	in the dxwnd.log file located in the game folder (if that folder is
	writable, when not possible the dxwnd.log file will be written
	elsewhere) while the game is running. So, once configured, run the
	game and look for the dxwnd.log file.</P>
	<P CLASS="rvps2" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">Since logs could be
	very verbose and write huge quantity of text, it is advisable to run
	the game for as little time as possible, interrupting the game
	session as soon as the problem occurs. Then, the log size can be
	reduced by file compression: the log is quite repetitive and
	compression rate is usually very high. Please, do not add more flags
	if not asked: that would easily generate more useless text making it
	more difficult to read and understand.</P>
	<HR>
	<P CLASS="rvps2" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><b>Special cases:</b></P>
	<P CLASS="rvps2" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">When hunting an
	occasional bug it may be inconvenient to get huge logs during the
	long time it takes until the problem occurs. In this situation it is
	possible to write the logs in a &quot;circular&quot; mode: in this
	case, two log files will be created and periodically swapped and
	overwritten, so that their size is trimmed to a maximum value. In
	this case it is necessary to collect and send both log files (named
	dxwnd.log and dxwnd.0.log).</P>

	<P CLASS="rvps2" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">If there are problems
	with the audio cd emulation, it is usually useless to grab
	informations about anything but the audio operations. In this case
	you should set only the &quot;Sound&quot; flag.</P>
