				Remaps the pathnames of files that are located in the Windows system folders to

				system folder that is usually located in "C:\Windows" is translated to the Windows 
				subfolder of the current folder. This prevents writing / reading files in the system
				folders and could be helpful to make portable applications with local configuration data.
				It should be noted that the flag may require early hooking to intercept operations 
				before the first window creation. In addition, it is not always garanteed that all 
				file accesses in system folders could be intercepted and redirected.
				All remapping folders will have to be created and be existing before the flag usage.
