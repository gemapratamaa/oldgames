<H3 CLASS="western">Uninstalling DxWnd</H3>
<P>DxWnd goal is to work without any impact on the
operating system or the target programs, so that the only thing you need to do in order to
uninstall DxWnd is simply to delete the folder where you copied its files.</P>
<P>
Neverthless, there are a very few optional and advanced features that you should be aware of
that have a limited impact on the operating system and target programs, so this page is giving
directions to completely delete any trace of DxWnd presence on your system, just in case you may want
it.
</P>
<P>
But in any case omitting to perform these suggested cleanup actions will not endanger in any way the 
correct system behavior.
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">File association</H3>
<P>
DxWnd menu command "Tool -> Associate export files" creates a permanent association between the ".dxw" 
file extension and the DxWnd program. This association is written in the system registry. If you remove or 
move DxWnd.exe in another folder, a broken association will remain in the system. To clear it, you have
to use the menu command "Tool -> Disassociate export files".
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Automatic startup</H3>
<P>
DxWnd can be set to automatically run at system start through the startup setting "Run at startup".
Also this setting is written in the system registry. 
Before deleting or moving DxWnd you could uncheck this option to avoid Windows trying to run a missing program.
<P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Log files</H3>
<P>
When logging is enabled, the target program will write one or more log files in the game folder. 
The file name will depend on the logging options, but in the most typical case it will be "dxwnd.log".
These files are overwritten at each program start, but never deleted and could take quite a lot of hard disk space.
It is recommended to search and delete these files when no longer useful.
<P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Proxies</H3>
<P>
DxWnd can install proxies to take effect permanently when DxWnd is not running or installed.
If you installed proxies, just remember that they will work until deleted (Proxy -> Remove command).
