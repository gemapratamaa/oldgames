How to Play	- see help link in game or goto www.mking.com
=======================

Key to the game is to work your way through the levels, while 
destroying the Boss at the end of each. Pick up bonuses along 
the way to increase your firepower to help you advance through 
the levels, while scoring as many points as possible. After 
upgrading your shot, pick up the same color to increase the 
power and ray of beam of that particular shot. If you 
accidentally pick up another color after multiple upgrades, it
will downgrade your shot to the weakest shot of that color.
Your destiny is to destroy the Demonstar SM2, at all costs!
